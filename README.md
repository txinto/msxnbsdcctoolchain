msxnbsdcctoolchain
==================

Toolchain for using SDCC to compile MSX files from Netbeans

Using the information at https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/cnd/toolchain.html we want to create a toolchain that allows us to compile C code for MSX using the SDCC compiler.

Currently in initial progress, the module is not working.

Please be patient or collaborative ;o)
